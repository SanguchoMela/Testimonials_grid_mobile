        <p id="p1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
            if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's
            worth.</p>
        <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking 
            to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience 
            here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! i
            enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
            - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've succesfully switched
            careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

        <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
            refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out
            in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is 
            above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible

        <p id="p5">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some 
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
            I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say 
            wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
            disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to 
            the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often
            referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
            multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
